# BudgetApp

to start app:
#cd budget-backend
#nodemon

in another terminal:
#cd budget-frontend
#npm start

Project uses react for frontend and NodeJS (Express) for backend. Data is stored in MongoDB. I have created authentication and authorization functionality from scratch both on frontend and backend.
